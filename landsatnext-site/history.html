            <h2>The Birth of a Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The Landsat program represents one of humanity's most ambitious and successful endeavors in Earth science. Its origins trace back to the early space age, when scientists and policymakers recognized the immense potential of observing Earth from space.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>1965: The Founding Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1965, <strong>William Pecora</strong>, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), proposed the groundbreaking idea of a remote sensing satellite program dedicated to gathering comprehensive data about Earth's natural resources. This visionary proposal would eventually become the Landsat program.

                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The program was further shaped in 1966, largely as a direct result of the demonstrated utility of Mercury and Gemini orbital photography for Earth resource studies. These early space missions proved that orbital imagery could provide invaluable insights into our planet's geology, vegetation, and land use patterns.
