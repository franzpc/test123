            <h1>Landsat Next: A Quantum Leap in Earth Observation</h1>
            <p>Three satellites. Twenty-six spectral bands. Unprecedented resolution. The future of Earth monitoring begins in 2030.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Mission Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Landsat Next represents the most ambitious evolution in the 50+ year history of the Landsat program. Scheduled for launch in late 2030/early 2031, this revolutionary mission will deploy a constellation of three identical satellites, each equipped with cutting-edge instruments capable of observing Earth in 26 different wavelengths of light and thermal energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This next-generation system will provide more than double the spectral information of current Landsat satellites, with enhanced spatial and temporal resolution that will transform our ability to monitor critical Earth systems, from water quality and agricultural health to climate change impacts and natural disasters.

                    <h3>🛰️ Three-Satellite Constellation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike previous single-satellite missions, Landsat Next will operate as a coordinated constellation of three spacecraft. This configuration will provide coverage of the same area <strong>every six days at the equator</strong>—nearly three times faster than the current 16-day cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This enhanced temporal resolution is critical for monitoring rapidly changing phenomena such as flood events, agricultural crop development, and wildfire progression.

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>📊 26 Spectral Bands</h3>
                    <p>
                        Landsat Next will measure 26 distinct spectral bands across visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared regions—<strong>more than double</strong> the 11 bands of Landsat 8 and 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These additional bands enable new applications in water quality monitoring, vegetation stress detection, soil composition analysis, and atmospheric studies.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>🔍 Enhanced Spatial Resolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most Landsat Next bands will feature <strong>10-20 meter resolution</strong>—a significant improvement over the current 30-meter standard. This finer detail enables identification of smaller features and more precise mapping of land cover changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The enhanced resolution is particularly valuable for urban planning, precision agriculture, and coastal zone management.

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>🌡️ Five Thermal Bands</h3>
                    <p>
                        Expanding from two thermal infrared bands to <strong>five</strong>, Landsat Next will provide dramatically improved surface temperature measurements and material emissivity characterization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This capability is crucial for drought monitoring, urban heat island studies, wildfire detection, and volcanic activity monitoring.
